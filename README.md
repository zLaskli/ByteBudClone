## Using Copilot as the Driver

**Step 1:** Enter this prompt in the chat to prime Copilot to act as the driver:

> Can you act as a pair programmer for me while I work on this project? I'd like you to act as the driver while I act as the navigator. You will suggest code a few lines at a time and also explain what the code does. I will keep track of the bigger picture and check your code to make sure itâ€™s doing what we want it to do.

**Step 2:** Write your code to complete the program. Every **1-2 minutes**, check in with Copilot like you would if your driver was one of your peers. For example, you could:

   * Have it decompose the problem into steps
   * Prompt Copilot for code for a specific step and enter it into your editor
   * Provide feedback to Copilot on code that it generated to improve the solution or suggest a different way to write the code
   * Suggest fixes to Copilot for any syntax or logic errors
   * Make sure that the code it suggests will solve the problem

Either as you go or after you are done writing your program, answer the following questions to reflect your experience using Copilot as the driver.
